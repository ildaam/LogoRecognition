A logo recognition system using Tensorflow Object Detection API.

Tensorflow Object Detection API is a framework made for easily implementing machine learning models which are capable of solving object detection problems.

This project uses a Logos In The Wild dataset in order to train an object detection model to recognise new unseen images of logos. 

The initial model used is SSD Resnet50 V1 FPN 640x640 which is a pre-trained model provided by Tensorflow. Other models will be trained to in order to find the one that gives the best trade-off between performance and speed.
